# ML-accelerator
With the increased interest and use of machine learning algorithms the use of ML accelerators will be greatly increased since they optimized for ML algorithms and show
better performance over CPUs and GPUS

I will be exploring TPUs and FPGAs which are used to perform ML operations
ML accelerators will help in large scale ML deployment and further use of such algorithms to simplify tasks.
